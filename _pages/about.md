Hello! My name is Paryag, and I am a PhD Scholar at the Central University of Himachal Pradesh. My research interests span across astrophysics and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on the intersection of these fields.

I am deeply fascinated by the cosmos and dedicated to understanding the universe's evolution. My current research involves utilizing powerful astronomical telescopes to study distant galaxies and other celestial phenomena. I am also leveraging convolutional neural networks and other AI techniques to analyze complex astronomical data.

Outside of my research, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through presentations and talks. Recently, I gave a seminar on the advancements in astronomical telescopes and their role in uncovering the universe's mysteries.
